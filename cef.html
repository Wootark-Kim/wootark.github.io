			A New Law?
		</div>

		<div id="cef1">
			<p>
				In the previous topic, I talked about weight and bias. Within an ai's model, this is known as
				paramters. The more parameter an ai model has, the more "flexibility" it will have in recognizing
				complex patterns. In other words, bigger ai models have more paramaters that allow it to capture
				more complex and subtle patterns in data. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The size of an ai's model is important as it has a correlation to it's error rate.
				To increase the accuracy of an AI's model output, the general solution is to simply 
				train it with more data. This results in it's errorneous output to be dramatically 
				reduced, but it will eventually plateau/level out.
			</p>
			<p>
				To increase it's accuracy rate beyond just feeding it more data, we can increase the size of the ai's model
				by providing it with more parameters. The problem is, while this will increase accuracy vs a smaller ai model, it
				still runs into the same problem where eventually the accuracy will level out. An additional hinderance is the 
				problem that a larger ai model will require more computing power. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If we were to graph this relation of error rate vs computing power required, we will see a graph that looks like this:
			</p>

					<i>Drawn by Wootark Kim.</i>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img src="img/logarithmic.jpg" alt="Picture of neural network" class="image">
					<i>Figure 2: The same graph but in logarithmic scale + more AI models.</i> <br>
					<i>Drawn by Wootark Kim.</i>
				</figure>
			</div>

			<div id="cef2">
				<p>
					Figure 2, however, shows the result if were to convert the graph to a logarithmic scale and add more, larger and larger, 
					AI models. We can see a trend here where a line appears. A curious phenomenon where no AI models can seem to pierce this
					line. This line is known as a the compute efficient frontier.
				</p>
				<p>
					An interesting question that now arises is: <br>
					Is this line some form of fundamental law or a happenstance limitation caused by a specific approach?
