			<p>
                The man who wrote JAVA was Rya... James Gosling.
			</p>
			<p>
                The legend himself created JAVA while during his employment at Sun Microsystems during the 90s. Though it would
                unfair not to include Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton who also worked on JAVA development.
			</p>
			<p>
                Originally JAVA was 
                called Oak but got renamed to JAVA due to 2 reasons: copyright issue around the work Oak and the fact that
                the development team liked coffee. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Eventually James left Sun Microsystems once Oracle bought out the company. His next journey took him to a short
                employment at Google where he then moved onto Liqid Robotics (later bought out by Boeing). He eventually retired in
                2024. 
			</p>
            <p>
                While James would be considered wealthy compared to most of us commonors (he reporetly has around +10 million), he
                did not earn any profit or royalties from his JAVA creation, as Sun Microsystems owned the right to the language.
            </p>
