			Basics of Neural Network Structure
		</div>

		<div id="neural1">
			<p>
			A neural network structure as 3 elements: </p><br>
			<ol>
				<li>input</li>
				<li>weights</li>
				<li>bias</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The input is the value that comes from other nodes (aka "neurons"). 
				The weights can be thought up as the "preference" strength of that data value. 
				The higher the value, the more "important" that value is compared to other inputs.
				The bias is the node's likelihood to send a signal. 
			</p>

		<div id="neural2">
			<p>
				As you can see, the resemblance its quite strong, hence the name "neural network" as it 
				took inspiration from the neuron architecture found in the physical world.
			</p>

			<p>
				To further expand the analogy, the input is simply the electrical signal that originates 
				from another neuron. The weight is probably how "strong" and well connected the dendrites 
				are (since it is receiving signals) in relation to that other neuron it is connected to. The 
				bias is the node's "resting potential." 
			</p>
			<p>
				A human neuron has a general resting potential of 
				-70 mV. For a node, the value of the bias determines whether it will likely continue to send
				the signal it received to another node. Having a low or negative bias value means it may not pass 
				along the signal it just received to another node and will require a greater strength value of the
				received data to overcome this hindrance. Thus the lower the bias value, the greater the threshold
				of the node's activation. The higher the bias value, the lower the threshold of the node's activation. <br>
